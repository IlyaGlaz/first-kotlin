 * A detecting device compares the size of components produced by a machine against the reference component.
 *
 * If the size of the component is larger, it can be fixed; the detector prints 1.
 * If the size of the component is smaller, it is deemed as a rejection; the detector prints -1.
 * If the component is perfect, it is sent to the box; the detector prints 0.
 *
 * Write a program which takes n (the number of parts) as input and then the detector sequence.
 * The program should output three numbers in a single line â€” the number of perfect components,
 * the number of larger components, and the number of rejections.
